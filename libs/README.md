# self-contained shot profile WEM

It's a pain to compile the canned SPWEM code from Seismic.jl, so heres 
a self contained repo for it. To build this I've just frankensteined 
out pieces of Aaron's code (all credit to him!). To compile this stuff
you'll need a version of GCC with OpenMP, FFTw, and all the standard
C libs.
